# Mycelium Backup recovery utility
This is a built version of the Backup utility for mycelium legacy backup (pdf backups)

The binary is already built, so if you want to use it right away go ahead and download the jar file and the bash/batch script in the repo.
The way how you use the tool is you run the program as a command using java and add your encrypted private key as well as the alphabetic passphrase as parameters.
